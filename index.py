<h1>Shot of Jaqy</h1>
<p>The Shot of Jaqy wave gadget and robot were created to embed the
<a href="http://www.shotofjaq.org">Shot of Jaq</a> rss feed into a wave.
You can see the embedded gadget in the Shot of Jaq
<a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BzCvDkNZdF">
public wave</a>.
The gadget xml file currently resides at
<a href="http://shotofjaqybot.appspot.com/assets/shotofjaqy.xml">
http://shotofjaqybot.appspot.com/assets/shotofjaqy.xml
</a>
which you can use to embed into your own wave.</p>
<p>The robot isn't functional yet. The idea is to have it update the wave
with new shots and comments as they come in.</p>
